# LinkedInAutomation
This repository contains code to automate replying to all your LinkedIn Comments

Best way of learning is experimenting with it!
Wanted to know more about JavaScript, Automating Web Interactions with JavaScript (JS) and DOM. My mom & I (sometimes) receive a 100s of comments on social media, and it gets very difficult to reply to each of them. Usually she ends replying in one comment with something like 'Thank you All' comments and I was just too lazy to reply to all I got as well. To get a better understanding of the JS based automation and how DOM updates based on interactions, I decided to write a JS based script to reply to all comments from my LinkedIn post. Code for the same attached in linkedInAutoReplyComment.js (In case you or your social media Influencer friends want to use)

To run the code:

1. Open LinkedIn and the post to whose comments you want to reply to
2. Open Developer tools in the browser (Inspect Element)
3. (Optional) You can change the content of the comment you want to reply everyone with.
4. Copy the JavaScript based code in the console window of Developer Tools of the browser and experince the magic!

Possible Improvements:
-> If I had spare tokens of OpenAI GPT-4 or similar, than I would have sent the content of each comment to it to generate an apt personalized response for each comment and reply with that response!

Takeaways:
-> Initially for a while I was stuck as the script was not working in-spite it seemed perfect. Soon, I realized that the reply button only appears after one enters some text in the comment box. Thus, I got the thought the issue might be not having delay. And delay, was the fix! 

Would love to hear your feedback and comments, Thank you so much!
